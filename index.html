            the right way I am telling you something about my life. I am 22
            years old and live in Ense (a small village next to Dortmund"). I
            was born and raised in Dresden and moved to Dortmund. In my freetime
            I do lots of sport, like soccer and basketball. By the way my
            favourite basketball team are the Golden State Warriors.

          <h3>It´s football time!</h3>
          <p class="P-Football-Time">
            Yeah as you know I like football very much.. I play football since I
            was 3 years old. I started in Dresden and played there for 11 years.
            As you can imagine, it was kind of hard to combine football with
            school. Normally I had at least three football sessions plus a game
            in a week. Since I was ten I had five football sessions a week plus
            game. I went do a special sport school in Dresden, which is focused
            to comine professional sport with the duty of school. With 14 I
            moved to Dortmund and played for Borussia Dortmund. At my Time in
            Dortmund I made memories I do not want to miss my whole life! In the
            U15 I played for the German national team and had a tournament in
            the Caribik. The following years I travelled a lot due to the
            tournements and international games. The best trips were to Namibia
            and South Korea but also the games in the Youth League, so I saw
            most of the big cities in Europe. In the U23 I got injured and had
            to quit with professional football. Titles: U19 German National
            Championship

          <h3>See you Down Under!</h3>
          <p class="Down-Under">
            After my bad injury I wanted do get my mind clear. A fresh start in
            my new life! My Choice to travel around Australia a time was one of
            the best decisions in my life so far! I saw so many beautiful places
            (I can not count every beach I saw) and met a lot new friends there.
            I bought a big car and started to travel around the south and east
            coast. This two pictures of me are showing two of my favourite
            places:

          <ul class="List-Australia">
            <li class="List-Australia-Phillip-Island">
              <strong>Phillip Island</strong>: What an island! The best thing
              here a the smallest pinguins of the world! In the evening you can
              see them coming out of the water to go back to there families. It
              is definitely worth a visit here. Come with your car and you can
              drive around the whole island in one day and see a lot of things.
              Not only the pinguins, especially the Koala Park is great! Here
              you can see Koalas in there natural habitat: On eucalyptus trees!

            <li class="List-Australia-Melbourne">
              <strong>Melbourne</strong>: I. Love. This. City. You want to eat
              amazing food? Come to Melbourne. You want to enjoy the nightlife?
              Come to Melbourne. You want to see great architecture? Come to
              Melbourne. This city has its own vibe and is one of the most
              enjoyable and relaxed city I was. Everybody is friendly and kind,
              you can go to the train station here and you can have five new
              friends in ten minutes if you want to. What else can I say about
