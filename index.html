          Here is something about me you can read about! To start this article
          the right way I am telling you something about my life. I am 22 years
          old and live in Ense (a small village next to Dortmund"). I was born
          and raised in Dresden and moved to Dortmund. In my freetime I do lots
          of sport, like soccer and basketball. By the way my favourite
          basketball team are the Golden State Warriors.

          Yeah as you know I like football very much.. I play football since I
          was 3 years old. I started in Dresden and played there for 11 years.
          As you can imagine, it was kind of hard to combine football with
          school. Normally I had at least three football sessions plus a game in
          a week. Since I was ten I had five football sessions a week plus game.
          I went do a special sport school in Dresden,

          After my bad injury I wanted do get my mind clear. A fresh start in my
          new life! My Choice to travel around Australia a time was one of the
          best decisions in my life so far! I saw so many beautiful places (I
          can not count every beach I saw) and met a lot new friends there. I
          bought a big car and started to travel around the south and east
          coast. This two pictures of me are showing two of my favourite places:

          <li class="List-Australia-Phillip-Island">
            <strong>Phillip Island</strong>: What an island! The best thing here
            a the smallest pinguins of the world! In the evening you can see
            them coming out of the water to go back to there families. It is
            definitely worth a visit here. Come with your car and you can drive
            around the whole island in one day and see a lot of things. Not only
            the pinguins, especially the Koala Park is great! Here you can see
            Koalas in there natural habitat: On eucalyptus trees!

          <li class="List-Australia-Melbourne">
            <strong>Melbourne</strong>: I. Love. This. City. You want to eat
            amazing food? Come to Melbourne. You want to enjoy the nightlife?
            Come to Melbourne. You want to see great architecture? Come to
            Melbourne. This city has its own vibe and is one of the most
            enjoyable and relaxed city I was. Everybody is friendly and kind,
            you can go to the train station here and you can have five new
            friends in ten minutes if you want to. What else can I say about
            this city... Melbourne? One day I am coming back to you!
