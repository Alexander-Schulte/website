          Here is something about me you can read about! To start this article
          the right way I am telling you something about my life. I am 22 years
          old and live in Ense (a small village next to Dortmund"). I was born
          and raised in Dresden and moved to Dortmund. In my freetime I do lots
          of sport, like soccer and basketball. By the way my favourite
          basketball team are the Golden State Warriors.

          Yeah as you know I like football very much.. I play football since I
          was 3 years old. I started in Dresden and played there for 11 years.
          As you can imagine, it was kind of hard to combine football with
          school. Normally I had at least three football sessions plus a game in
          a week. Since I was ten I had five football sessions a week plus game.
          I went do a special sport school in Dresden,

          After my bad injury I wanted do get my mind clear. A fresh start in my
          new life! My Choice to travel around Australia a time was one of the
          best decisions in my life so far! I saw so many beautiful places (I
          can not count every beach I saw) and met a lot new friends there. I
          bought a big car and started to travel around the south and east
          coast. This two pictures of me are showing two of my favourite places:

            <strong>Phillip Island</strong>: What an island! The best thing here
            a the smallest pinguins of the world! In the evening you can see
            them coming out of the water to go back to there families. It is
            definitely worth a visit here. Come with your car and you can drive
            around the whole island in one day and see a lot of things. Not only
            the pinguins, especially the Koala Park is great! Here you can see
            Koalas in there natural habitat: On eucalyptus trees!
